# Sets

Sets are a simple, nifty little data structure. They're similar to arrays with one key difference: They only hold unique values.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Define a set and how itâ€™s used in programming. 
- Distinguish between a set, an array, and a linked list. 
- Implement a set and common methods used in sets.

## Prerequisites
* Big O Notation
